# CSS-ex1

Use the CSS that we learnt in the lesson to style some text.

Try to recreate a fancy headline like this one:
[link to image](/image.png)

Then make your own:

Choose a font, select colors, make it pretty.

Try to use:

- text-transform
- text-decoration
- text-shadow
- letter-spacing
- font-variant
